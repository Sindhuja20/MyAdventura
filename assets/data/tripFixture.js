                "Bangalore is home to many educational and research institutions and has played a significant role in the contribution towards skill development. Bangalore is considered to be one of the educational hubs in India.",
                "Call it the Silicon Valley of India or the Garden City or may be a Cosmopolitan city, for Bangalore can be anything you call it! It is also a city of paradoxes, another reason why you must see this place. The diversity, and the foreign influence, colourful history and the rich heritage have all made Bangalore a melting pot of culture. Today’s Bangalore is an interesting destination that intrigues people of all ages. You have everything from history to adventure, nightlife to book cafes, nature’s beauty to luxury malls, you name it, and you get it in Bangalore."
